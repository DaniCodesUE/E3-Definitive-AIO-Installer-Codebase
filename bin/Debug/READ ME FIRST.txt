Dying Light 2 – E3 Definitive Mod AIO Installer

:: CREATED FOR THE E3 DEFINITIVE TEAM ::
None of the in-game mod work was done by me; all credit goes to the talented E3 Def. Team.

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Steam version of Dying Light 2 (Epic Games version is not supported)
• Sufficient storage space (see below for details)

:: FEATURES ::
• Automatic Game Downgrade – Reverts the game to the correct version.
• Mod & Patch Installation – Installs the latest E3 Definitive Mod with all necessary patches.
• Integrated Audio Fix – Ensures proper sound functionality.
• Optimized Download System – Faster file retrieval via an alternative hosting method.

:: USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ::

Enter Steam credentials for authentication.

Select your Dying Light 2 installation folder.

Click “Start Installation” – the process is fully automated.

:: STEAM GUARD INSTRUCTIONS ::
• If using Steam Guard via Email:

Select "Steam Email" from the combo box.

Enter the code from your email when prompted.

Do not recheck the Steam Guard checkbox on the next launch.
• If using Steam Guard via App:

You’ll need to enter a new code each time a depot download is required (unavoidable due to SteamCMD limitations).

:: KNOWN ISSUES ::
• First Launch Version: This installer cannot currently patch an already installed game. A patching feature is in development and will be added in a future update.
• Storage Requirement: Ensure at least 150GB of free space, as the depot temporarily stores files in steamapps. SteamCMD rerouting attempts have been made, but some restrictions remain.

:: SUPPORT & FEEDBACK ::
• Report any issues or errors to Daniel on Discord: danielbruh.
• If needed, a tutorial may be recorded based on user feedback.

This tool simplifies the setup process, eliminating manual downgrading and mod installation steps. Use at your discretion, as this modifies game files.
